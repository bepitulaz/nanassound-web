          Driven by a fascination with modular synthesizers, Asep expanded Nanas Sound beyond music production. He began designing and building Eurorack modules, transforming his hobby into a brand. Today, Nanas Sound proudly offers DIY Eurorack modules and 3D-printed synth parts for fellow enthusiasts and creators.
