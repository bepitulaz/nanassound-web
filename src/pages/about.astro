          <b>Nanas Sound</b> was started as a music hobby project in 2021 by Asep Bagja in Tallinn, Estonia. He is a software engineer and electronic music enthusiast. Initially, the project was intended to release his own music. He does release his music, and you can listen to it on various streaming platforms:&nbsp;

          The project is growing because he is also interested in modular synthesizers and has started to design and build Eurorack modules. Today, Nanas Sound is a brand that sells DIY Eurorack modules and 3D-printed DIY synth parts.
